                <h2 class="sub-header">Find your Band Members and your Sound</h2>
                <p>Traditionally, you’ll need a drummer, a guitarist, a bassist, and a singer. But these days, your band can be made up of just about anything. Pianists, synth-players, horn players, and multi-instrumentalists are becoming more and more common. Many bands even don’t use guitars anymore. The only two instruments you should definitely consider having are a drumset (acoustic or electronic) and something to hold down the low end. This could be a bass guitar, an upright bass, a piano, or a synthesizer. Before you decide to put someone in the band, get together and jam with them. See what their talent level is and if their style blends with your own. Most importantly though, make sure that you have chemistry together. The next step is to figure out what your “sound” will be. At your first band meeting, talk about your influences. Who are your favorite artists? What’ve you all been listening to recently? Are there any genres that you have in-common? Your sound is likely going to be somewhere in-between those answers. Make sure to check out any songs that your members have already written. What genre do they tend to write in? Finally, jam a little bit. What sound organically comes up? You’ll want to write in a genre that feels most natural to all your bandmates.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-header">Find a Place to Practice, Start Writing, and Name your Band</h2>
                <p>You’ve got a lot of options. Where do you have access to? Basement? Garage? Church? Music venue before hours? Professional rehearsal space? Storage cube? You can get creative to find somewhere you can meet and get loud. Just make sure the place won’t get you in trouble. After a few noise complaints to the police, you’ll get some serious fines if you keep practicing there. If you’re meeting in a place that’s prone to this, try soundproofing the room. Next: time to write some songs! This is the exciting part. There’s nothing better than the artistic expression of creating something entirely new. Go wild. Be as creative as you want. Before you start, though, learn a few covers. It may sound boring, but it’s important. You want to make sure your group has learned to play well together before you start writing. It will make the entire process ten times easier. Once you’ve learned to play nicely together, really dive into the writing process. Songwriting prompts are a great way to get new songs started. To headline a show, you’ll need around twelve songs at least. That should be your goal at first. But don’t sacrifice quality for quantity. It’s more important to have six amazing songs than twelve average ones. Take your time. You can always play opening gigs (or covers) until you’ve written the amount you need. You can’t play shows until you come up with a band name. So while you’re writing songs, be brainstorming with your band members. My favorite technique is to get everyone in a room and stream-of-consciousness-style name any combination of words you can think of. After an hour or two of this, you’ll have pages and pages of potential band names. A lot of them will be crap, but you’ll have ten or fifteen really great ones.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-header">Record a Demo, and Search for Gigs, and Market</h2>
                <p>If you have the tech, then recording a demo or two is the next step. You want to have something that you can send venues when looking for gigs. They need to be able to hear what you sound like if you ever want them to give you a shot. Once you have a few songs recorded, it would be a good idea to edit them together into a 30-second mashup. If the venue owner sees that the audio clip is short, he or she is more likely to listen to it. Once you’ve got your name, your look, and your songs, it’s time to start playing some shows. To do that, you’ll need to convince venue owners to let you play there. Once you’ve found some shows, it’s time to start promoting yourself. You want as many people to show up at your first few shows as possible. That will show the venue owner that you can bring in some money, meaning they’ll invite you back again. With a crowd, you’ll have the energy you need to have a killer performance!</p>
