                <h2 class="sub-header">Chose the Band You want to Cover</h2>
                <p>When choosing the band that you want to cover, keep in mind the genre and style of the music that they are playing. This will allow you to know what other types of music you can play, if you want to branch out to other genres. Once you have chosen your band, make a silly name that is similar to the band you're covering, but not the exact same name. This will help your audience know what you are covering, as well as the type of music to expect at your shows. Then, you will need to make a set list of the songs. You should pick the most popular songs from this band for the first 7 or 8 songs in your list. Then you can choose 2 of any other song. Select a encore song just in case the huns want you to keep playing. The priority here, of course, is to make sure that the crowd is enjoying the show. If someone has walked into the room where you're performing, they'll be much more likely to stay if they like the songs you're playing. You'll never be able to please everyone, so you want to focus on what the majority of people want to hear. It's important to always remember that you are not playing for you, but rather, you're playing for the people that are listening to you. Once you hav done this, you are clear to move onto the next step. </p>

                <h2 class="sub-header">How to Perform for your Audience</h2>
                <p>As previously mentioned, your show and song list should be catered to the people in attendance. If you have a regular following, you should have a good idea of the kind of music that they expect to hear you play. Just like a company that has a physical product that they are looking to sell, your band has to have an intimate understanding of what the people want.

                    One of the best ways to determine the preferences of the crowd is to simply talk to them individually. Ask them what they like and don't like, why they like you, and how they think you could improve. Quite often, you won't even have to ask, and people will just voluntarily offer up information. Your job in this case is to simply pay attention and take it all in. Then you can process what you have to work with and base your presentation on what will yield the best results for everyone involved. In addition to talking to people when you're off stage, you also want to involve them when you're on stage. Singling out people in the audience to talk to gets the crowd more involved, and also makes them feel more a part of the show. It could be something as simple as mentioning someone's birthday or special occasion, or even at times bringing a person or people up on stage. It all becomes part of the show, and makes the whole event more fun for everyone.</p>
